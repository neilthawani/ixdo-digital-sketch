# Introduction

During this project, I took upon the role of a User Experience (UX) Designer to create a digital dashboard for a university Introduction to Game Design course. In this course, students present projects to a group of their peers (called listeners) and an instructor.

I was given a database with data to feed into the digital dashboard and user personas for three individuals:

- Joanna Blaine: a student presenter,
- Frank Tan: a student listener, and
- Professor Alanna Rodriguez: the course instructor.

I applied principles of UX Design to create a dashboard that served the needs of student listeners and the course instructor while remaining functional and aesthetically pleasing.

# Demos
