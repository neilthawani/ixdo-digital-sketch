   "response": "Considering that the focus is on stock market personal finance, it is difficult to win without it based on a level of pure luck. If less luck is desired, designing the game around interaction between players would be useful (for example, letting players choose from a hand of event cards with different effects depending on what other players are etc). For example, maybe assign players roles (lobbyist, blockchain investor etc), and depending on the card, special effects can be factored in.",

We knew before each session which elements/concepts we needed feedback on, so it was easier to level up what we wanted to know. For the consolidation exercise, we gridded out each feature against positive/negative/questions/alternative approach comments made and were able to extract patterns. Actionable feedback was determined to be whatever was common across a majority of testers.",
